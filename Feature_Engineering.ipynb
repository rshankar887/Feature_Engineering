        "    * For example, \"red\" might become 0, \"blue\" might become 1, and \"green\" might become 2.\n",
        "    * **Use Case:** Suitable for ordinal categorical variables, where there's a meaningful order between categories (e.g., \"low,\" \"medium,\" \"high\").\n",
        "    * **Caution:** Can introduce an unintended order for nominal categorical variables (where there's no inherent order), which might confuse the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **One-Hot Encoding:**\n",
        "    * This creates a binary column for each category.\n",

        "    * Each row would have a 1 in the column corresponding to its color and 0s in the other columns.\n",
        "    * **Use Case:** Ideal for nominal categorical variables.\n",
        "    * **Caution:** Can significantly increase the number of features, especially with high cardinality (many categories).\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Ordinal Encoding:**\n",
        "    * Used specifically for ordinal data. You manually assign numerical values based on the inherent ordering of the categories.\n",
        "    * For Example, \"Poor\", \"Average\", \"Excellent\", could be encoded 1,2, and 3.\n",
        "    * Gives you more control than label encoding, in these cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Target Encoding:**\n",
        "    * Replaces each category with the mean of the target variable for that category.\n",
        "    * **Use Case:** Can be very effective, especially for high-cardinality categorical variables.\n",
        "    * **Caution:** Prone to overfitting, so techniques like cross-validation and smoothing are often used.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Frequency Encoding:**\n",
        "    * Replaces each category with its frequency (or proportion) in the dataset.\n",
        "    * **Use Case:** Can be useful for high-cardinality categorical variables.\n",
